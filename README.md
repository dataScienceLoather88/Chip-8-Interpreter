# Chip-8-Interpreter
A basic Chip-8 interpreter written in C with SDL2.

Run the .exe using the command line. Takes one argument for the ROM filename. (e.g >chip-8.exe romName.ch8)

Mimics the behaviour of the original chip 8 so only software written specifically for that system will work reliably.

Chip-8 to Keyboard Mapping:

123C -> 1234

456D -> QWER

789E -> ASDF

A0BF -> ZXCV
